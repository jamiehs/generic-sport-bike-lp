## Generic Sport Bike Landing Page

I wanted to test the feasibility of driving traffic to a landing page about one of my royalty-free TurboSquid models. It doesn't really work that well. I bought a few keywords, and despite seeing a good number of clicks on the search results, the conversions were low and non existent.

**Note to code snobs out there:** 
I wrote this when CoffeeScript was more trendy (2014) than it is now (2016) and well before Babel and ES(n) were more of a path forward. Having said that, CoffeeScript rocks; but I can't see much of a future for it, so I've stopped using it.
